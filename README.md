lockplus code repo for webapp side of this project (should upload python files alongside it soon)

relevant variable information in PROCESSENV.txt file, essentially just copy that into a file called .env.local for all of the process.env calls to work.

By MVP plan is to have web skeleton fully functional and synced with python module.
